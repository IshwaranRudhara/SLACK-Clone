        <p>
          At the heart of Slack are channels: organized spaces for everyone and
          everything that you need for work. In channels, its easier to connect
          across departments, offices, time zones and even other companies.

          In Slack, you’ve got all the flexibility to work when, where and how
          it’s best for you. You can easily chat, send audio and video clips, or
          join a huddle to talk things through live.

          With your other work apps connected to Slack, you can work faster by
          switching tabs less. And with powerful tools like Workflow Builder,
          you can automate away routine tasks.
